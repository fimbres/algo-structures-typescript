# Algorithms & Data Scructures In TypeScript

This repository accompanies the **Computer Science and Interview Prep Course**, which crams months of computer science and interview preparation into 20 hours of video. The course is based on the curriculum from my in-person coding bootcamps, where students have successfully landed 6-figure developer jobs at companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Facebook.

The course starts with foundational concepts and progresses to advanced topics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of essential computer science concepts for technical interviews.
